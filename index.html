        <h3>US election: Trump and Biden deflect key questions in TV grilling</h3>
        <p>US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have batted away key questions during separate meet-the-voter TV events.
            Mr Trump, a Republican, declined to disavow a bizarre online conspiracy, while Mr Biden, a Democrat, would not divulge plans for the Supreme Court.
            Both candidates were on the defensive at times on their records, Mr Trump for a range of issues and Mr Biden on race.
            Opinion polls indicate Mr Biden has a solid lead over Mr Trump.

        <h3>Fukushima: Japan 'to release contaminated water into sea'</h3>
            <p>Japan is to release treated radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, media reports say.
                It follows years of debate over how to dispose of the liquid, which includes water used to cool the power station hit by a massive tsunami in 2011.
                Environmental and fishing groups oppose the idea but many scientists say the risk it would pose is low.
                The government says no final decision has been made.
                The release of more than a million tonnes of water, which has been filtered to reduce radioactivity, would start in 2022 at the earliest, according to Japanese media outlets including national dailies the Nikkei and the Yomiuri Shimbun.
